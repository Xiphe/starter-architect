# Remix Starter for Architect (AWS CloudFormation)

Welcome to Remix!

This is a starter repo for using [Remix](https://remix.run) with
[Architect](http://arc.codes) (wrapper around AWS CloudFormation).

## Development

The root of this project is an Architect project that follows Architect's project conventions. the Remix portion is just one endpoint found at `src/http/any-catchall`.

When developing your app, you'll need two terminal tabs, one to run Architect's sandbox, and the other to run the Remix development asset server. In production, however, the Remix asset server won't be used because your assets will be built and shipped with the server.

### From the root of this project

Architect recommends installing their CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @architect/architect
```

Now all you need to do from the root of this project is start the Architect sandbox:

```bash
arc sandbox
```

### From the Remix http handler directory

Now open another terminal tab and change directory into the Remix http handler.

```bash
cd src/http/any-catchall
```

Rename `.npmrc.example` to `.npmrc` and insert the license key you get from [logging in to your dashboard at
remix.run](https://remix.run).

> Note: if this is a public repo, you'll probably want to move the line with
> your key into `~/.npmrc` to keep it private.

Next, install all dependencies using `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

Your `@remix-run/*` dependencies will come from the Remix package registry.

Once everything is installed, start the app in development mode with the
following command:

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

This will run a two processes concurrently (`remix run` and a TypeScript
watcher) that will dynamically rebuild as your source files change. To see
your changes, refresh the browser.

> Note: Hot module reloading is coming soon, which will allow you to see your
> changes without refreshing.

Now you should be able to visit http://localhost:3333. (Note that `:3334` is not your server, it's the Remix development asset server).

## Deploying

From the Remix http handler, build the app for production:

```bash
cd src/http/any-catchall
remix build
```

And then from the root of the project, deploy with `arc`.

```bash
cd ../../..
arc deploy prduction
```

That's it!

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for Remix [is available at
remix.run](https://remix.run/dashboard/docs).

## Remix Project Structure

There are 2 main directories you will want to be familiar with: `app` and
`data`.

- The `app` directory contains the major pieces that make up the frontend of
  your application. These include the entry points, routes, and CSS files.
  Most of the code in this directory runs both on the server _and_ in the
  browser.
- The `data` directory contains modules that serve as your "backend".
  These functions run only in node.js.

Remix is responsible for compiling everything in your `app` directory so that it
can run both on the server (to render the HTML needed for the page, aka
server-side rendering or "SSR") and in the browser. It's your responsibility to
compile the code in `data`, if needed.

This project uses TypeScript for type safety. There are two main TypeScript
configs in `app/tsconfig.json` and `data/tsconfig.json`. The `tsconfig.json`
in the project root is a "solution" file that just contains
[references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html)
to the other two configs.
